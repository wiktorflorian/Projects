# Projects

My personal projects:

**csv_divider** - script is responsible for dividing csv files to smaller csv files. Input file, outpur directory, delimiter, and output files names are specified by user (default delimiter is ";" and default file name is chunk_x.csv. Scrip is using os, csv and math packages. Example usage is based on amazon.csv dataset from https://data.world/promptcloud/amazon-mobile-phone-reviews. Datasets is free to download but to do it you have to create account on data.world. Another way is to use my output files and concatenate them into one file using pandas.
